Be aware that there are tiny magnets in them so that you can perch the ppl onto the animals & keep them there. I almost didn\\u2019t buy them bc of that given all the news stories about kids and magnets, but the magnets are INSIDE the toys. So as long as ur kids aren\\u2019t eating their toys you should be okay, but be careful around your pets so that the pets don\\u2019t try to eat them.  My grandkids adore all things Schleich as do I bc I bought it for their parents too decades ago.  Schleich is well made & lasts forever.\",\n",
